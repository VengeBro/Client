This plugin plays Sound Effect 1 every tick, and Sound Effect 2 every X ticks,
where X is the interval specified in the configuration.
Using X = 0 will simply play Sound Effect 1 every tick (standard metronome).

Press shift to reset the ticking, so that Sound Effect 2 will play on the next tick.

List of possible sound effect ids to use:
3929 (Standard ticking noise, taken from Grand Exchange)
